# TimeLine [Back End]
Time-Line application for Flatiron Final Project

This application is a prelude to my portfolio.
The thought process is to create a Time-Line that utilizes an API to index Events/Jobs/Educational 
oppurtunities releavant to future software engineering endeavors.

Specifications:
Created with react-router
  SPA (one HTML page to render whole appp)
  2 container components
  5 stateless components
  Redux middleware
  Rails API
  
- There will be 3 routes:
  1. Main/Home Page
  2. About me
  3. Timeline [components]
  
  *due to specifications of Flatiron's Final Project list may expand*
